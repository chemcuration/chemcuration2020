# ChemCuration 2020

ChemCuration ([#chemcur2020](https://twitter.com/hashtag/chemcur2020)) is the second
one day, online-only conference around data curation and curated data in the
domain of chemistry, after [ChemCuration 2019](https://chemcuration.github.io/chemcuration2019/).
Inspired by BioCuration and by other online conferences, this year will mark
the first edition of a Twitter-based online poster conference. During the day, you will tweet your
poster with the meeting hashtag and respond to questions about the poster in the 24 hours after
your tweet. The poster must be available in an online repository (e.g. Zenodo or Figshare)
under the CCZero, CC-BY or CC-BY-SA license.

The meeting scope: anything around data curation and curated data of *open science* data in
chemistry. This includes but is not limited to:

* a new release of curated open data
* FAIR metadata around open data
* open source tools for data curation

## Date and Venue

ChemCuration 2020 will take place later this year. The venue is Twitter&nbsp;[1].

## More soon

The 2020 edition is being planned, and we'll let you know more as soon as possible.
